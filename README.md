# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was a video game company that wanted to design a web-based game application, called Draw It or Lose It, that can be played on multiple platforms. They wanted the game to have 4 rounds that were 30 seconds each where a team guesses a rendering drawing.   

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel that I did particularly well on the section called Evaluation and Recommendation in the Software Design template.  In the Evaluation section, we took a look at various platforms, as well as the different considerations when it comes to each platform. We also evaluated the client and server side when it came to each traditional operating system. In the recommendation section of the template, we evaluated my finds and made a recommendation to the client as to what operating system is best for the application that they are wanting to create.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

When it comes to the design document, the most helpful part I found was the Domain Model. I'm a visual learner, so the UML diagram and explaining the relationships that are in the diagram helped me determine how to develop my code. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
A part I would revise would be the evaluation section. I would revise it to include video game consoles such as virtual reality, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch in order to put all platforms in perspective to the client so they can cross reference the information with the other operating systems.   

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When figuring out a user's needs, it needs to be compared to their wants. Differentiating the two will help during the designing process. It's important to distinguish the two because implementing a want may cause rework to be done or may cause more complication than intended from the client. It is very important to consider the user's needs because that will make the application much more appealing. If the game is more appealing to the user, then one can only hope that the installation numbers will increase, and in return, bring in more revenue. Also, if the company does not wish to sell anything in a "shop", it could potentially bring the client's name to light and therefore have more of a follower base.  

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached design in a way that others can take a look without having a background and hopefully feel more confident about maintaining or developing more of the current application. When I chose my recommendation as to what operating system I would go with, I recommended windows. This is because it is the most user friendly and a widely used platform; However, close behind it was iOS. I believe that this is was a good strategy when it came to the design of software, and I will probably use that to have a basis for future applications
